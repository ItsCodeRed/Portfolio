                  In 2020, the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Rocket_Sledge">Rocket Sledge</a> hosted the first ever 
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x53kCucaLlI">Rocket League Airshow</a>. This competition challenged Rocket League botmakers to make extravagant
                  aerial shows using their bot-making skills for $1000! And in 2021, the Rocket League Airshow returned, and I decided to participate.<br><br>

                  However, it took me a bit to come to that decision. In fact, by the time I signed up, there was only a month until the due-date, when I should've
                  had two months. But I decided to do it anyway. The code from the submissions to the previous airshows was made open-source, so I was allowed to 
                  look at the code and take some inspiration, as long as I didn't copy entire segments. So I got started learning how to code this thing in Python.<br><br>
                  
                  I used some hover code from a previous airshow submission, Awakening, and some airdribble code shared publicly by someone on the RLBot discord.
                  Other than that, everything was my own code. And not only did I have to code all the aerial manuevers, but I also had to film and edit the entire 
                  piece to music. Now is probably a good time to mention that my competition were mostly teams of several people, with dedicated video editors and programmers.
                  I was one of two people doing this thing solo.<br><br>

                  So, I worked, and I worked. I even decided to make a custom Rocket League map for a part of my airshow, although it was super simple to create. I somehow 
                  managed to submit my airshow in time. In the end, there were only three other submissions apart from mine. And in the end, my submission got 3rd/4th,
                  only losing to the two submissions who had teams of people working on them, so I was really pleased! And, bonus, I won $200 for getting 3rd!<br><br>

                  You can check out my submission on YouTube, Github, or just check out the entire 2021 Rocket League Airshow. The other submissions were amazing as well!
