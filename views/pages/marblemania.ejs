          When I was only 12 years old, I started learning how to make games. At that time, I was using <a
            href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker">GameMaker Studio</a>, and I was avoiding
          learning programming because I thought it would be too hard. But at some point along the process,
          I decided to try out the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game engine.<br><br>
          Of course, with this engine, you HAD to learn programming to get anywhere, so
          I started following tutorials, and started work on my first <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game!
          Inspired off of my <a href="/youtube.html">YouTube videos</a>,
          I decided to make the game a marble racing, platformer game. After many monthes of work, I evantually released
          <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/MarbleMania/287568">Marble Mania</a>
          on October 1st, 2017.<br><br>
          Since I already had a pretty large following on my <a href="/youtube.html">YouTube channel</a>, a suprising
          number of people
          played the game! At the time of writing, the game has over 15,500 downloads on GameJolt! Which is just
          insane.<br><br>
          Over the years, I've updated the
          game quite a few times, including a huge graphics overhaul on the one year anniversary of the game. But
          sometime during 2020,
          I lost interest in the project, and that's where the story ends.
