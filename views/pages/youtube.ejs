          My YouTube channel, created in 2013, currently has <div class="sub-count inline"></div> subscribers. I upload many types of videos. 
          Most of these videos followed a similar format, where the viewers would pick a side to cheer for in a game that would play itself throughout the video. 
          Often these games were marble races, but I made up many other gamemodes as well.<br><br>
          At first, I'd make these games in a physics program called <a href="http://www.algodoo.com">Algodoo</a>. However, as my interest in programming grew through scripting in <a href="http://www.algodoo.com">Algodoo</a>, 
          my interest in these videos began to fade. That's when I created and switched to my second channel, now named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQ-0Obw76YoTXhayiyVgMw">CodeRed2</a>, which currently has <div class="sub-count-2 inline"></div> subscribers.
          This channel focused more on my programming interests, including tutorials and videos on my <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a> games. However, after a while, 
          I decided to switch back to my main channel, as it felt wrong leaving my channel with <div class="sub-count inline"></div> subscribers behind.<br><br>
          Nowadays, I make many types of videos. Some of them adhere to the original format that made my channel popular, but now made in <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a>, 
          as a way of showing my game design and programming skills. I also make videos on other projects, such as my <a href="/redutils">Rocket League bots</a>. My YouTube channel is not in its peak anymore, 
          but I'm glad I have a place to show my projects to the world. Check me out by clicking the logo above!
